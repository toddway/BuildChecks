A Gradle plugin to post summaries from code analyzers to [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/) & [BitBucket](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/how-tos/updating-build-status-for-commits/).  E.g.:

[ ![Gradle Plugin](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v/https/plugins.gradle.org/m2/com/toddway/buildchecks/com.toddway.buildchecks.gradle.plugin/maven-metadata.xml.svg?label=Gradle%20Plugin) ](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.toddway.buildchecks)


    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 11s
    9 actionable tasks: 7 executed, 2 up-to-date
    ✔ 10.05s for gradle postChecks
    ✔ 79.33% coverage, threshold is 70.0%
    ✔ 5 rule violations (5 warning), threshold is 5
    ✔ Posting to GITHUB


The plugin parses common output formats (Cobertura, JaCoCo, Checkstyle, Android Lint)
supported by many lint and coverage tools (Detekt, SwiftLint, ESLint, TSLint, Istanbul)

## Installation
If you're not already using Gradle on your project,
you should [install it](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)
and [initialize it for your project](https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/).

Then add the following to the build.gradle file at the root of your project:

    plugins {
        id "com.toddway.buildchecks" version "$buildchecks_version"
    }

## Usage
To print build checks only to the console, add `printChecks` to a Gradle task (likely one that generates supported lint and coverage reports).  For example:

    task checks {
        dependsOn 'testDebugUnitTestCoverage'
        dependsOn 'lintDebug'
        dependsOn 'cpdCheck'
        dependsOn 'detekt'
        finalizedBy ':printChecks'
    }

To post build checks to your remote source control system, add `postChecks`:

    task checks {
        dependsOn 'testDebugUnitTestCoverage'
        dependsOn 'lintDebug'
        dependsOn 'cpdCheck'
        dependsOn 'detekt'
        finalizedBy ':postChecks'
    }


If you're running a non-Gradle command (e.g. `npm deploy`, `myBuildScript.sh`, `fastlane`),
you can attach postChecks by letting Gradle execute your command.
Gradle lets you define custom executables like this:

    task myCustomTask(type: Exec) {
        workingDir 'path/to/optional/subdirectory'
        commandLine 'npm', 'deploy'
    }

    myCustomTask.finalizedBy(postChecks)


The exit value of the external command (0 or 1) will determine if success or failure is posted for the build.

## Config
To configure the details of your build output and your source control system, add a buildChecks block to your build.gradle.
All example properties below are optional.

    buildChecks {
        baseUrl = "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>" 
        authorization = "Basic <your generated token>"
        buildUrl = System.getenv('BUILD_URL') ? System.getenv('BUILD_URL') : "http://localhost"
        androidLintReports = "$projectDir/build/reports/lint-results-prodRelease.xml" //comma seperated paths
        checkstyleReports = "$projectDir/build/reports/detekt-checkstyle.xml" //comma separated paths
        jacocoReports = "$projectDir/build/reports/jacoco/coverage/coverage.xml" //comma seperated paths
        coberturaReports = "$projectDir/functions/coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml" //comma separated paths
        minCoveragePercent = 80 
        maxLintViolations = 5
        maxDuration = 60 //in seconds
     }

#### baseUrl
Github - `https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>`

Bitbucket (REST 2.0) - `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/<owner>/<repo>/`

Bitbucket Server (REST 1.0) - `https://bitbucket.yourserver.com`


#### authorization
Generate basic authorization for Github (or Bitbucket) with this command:

    curl -v -u username:password github.com
    
Then find the following line and use the result in your BuildChecks config. 

    > Authorization: Basic <your generated token>

Instead of using your actual account password in the curl command, Github and Bitbucket both offer safer substitutes.  
 
Github - Your profile image -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens.

Bitbucket - Your profile image -> Bitbucket settings -> App passwords. 

Bitbucket Server - Your profile image -> Manage account -> Personal access tokens.
